------------------------------------------------------
--- Detector length:	2 m  
--- Detector inner radius:	80 cm 
--- Number of layers:	90

--- 1st layer: 	1.4 mm  of passive G4_W
--- 2nd layer: 	300 um  of active G4_Si
-----------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------
 Readout geometry with physics layout is set in parallel geometry:	
 Cylindrical detector is divided along radius (layers), phi (slices), and z (rows).
 Number of layers is determined by number of layers set in detector construction. 
- Number of layers: 90
------- Number of slices: 320
- Number of rows: 100
 Readout will collect energy for full simulation.
------- Therefore thickness is only a thickness of sensitive absorbers = 300 um 
-----------------------------------------------------
Checking overlaps for volume Detector:9999 (G4Tubs) ... OK!
