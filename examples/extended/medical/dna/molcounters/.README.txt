\ This folder contains two examples,
(1) basic; and\n
(2) sdcounters.\n

1) "basic" focuses on the use of the molecule counter manager
system and how to register different counters and adjust their
parameters like, e.g., activation and time precision.\n

2) "sdcounters" shows how to use primitive scorers and a multi-
functional detector to record and write out molecule counts.\n

Please refer to each example's README for further information.\n
