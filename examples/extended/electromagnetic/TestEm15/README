        How to compute and plot the final state of:
	 - Multiple Scattering
	 - Gamma Conversion
	considered as an isolated processes, see PHYSICS.

	For Multiple Scattering, the method is exposed below.

	For Gamma Conversion, when G4BetheHeitler5DModel Model is used.

 1- GEOMETRY DEFINITION

        It is a single box representing a 'semi infinite' homogeneous medium.
        Two parameters define the geometry:
        - the material of the box,
        - the (full) size of the box.

        The default geometry (100 m of water) is constructed in
        DetectorConstruction, but the above parameters can be changed
        interactively via the commands defined in DetectorMessenger.

 2- PHYSICS LIST

        The physics list contains the standard electromagnetic processes.
        In order not to introduce 'artificial' constraints on the step size,
        there is no limitation from the maximum energy lost per step.

 3- AN EVENT: THE PRIMARY GENERATOR

        The primary kinematic consists of a single particle starting at the edge
        of the box. The type of the particle and its energy are set in
        PrimaryGeneratorAction (1 MeV electron), and can be changed via the G4
        build-in commands of ParticleGun class (see the macros provided with
        this example).

 4- PHYSICS

        All discrete processes are inactivated (see provided macros),
        so that Multiple Scattering or Gamma Conversion is 'forced' to
        determine the first step of the primary particle.
        The step size and the final state are computed  and plotted.
        Then the event is immediately killed.

	Multiple Scattering:

	The result is compared with the 'input' data, i.e. with the cross
        sections stored in the PhysicsTables and used by Geant4.
        The stepMax command provides an additional control of the step size of
        the multiple scattering.


 5- HISTOGRAMS

        The test contains 16 built-in 1D histograms, which are managed by
        G4AnalysisManager and its Messenger. The histos can be individually
        activated with the command:
        /analysis/h1/set id nbBins  valMin valMax unit
        where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, etc..)
        (see the macros xxxx.mac).

        2       Multiple Scattering. Geom step length
        3       Multiple Scattering. Ratio geomSl/trueSl
        4       Multiple Scattering. Lateral displacement: radius

        8       Multiple Scattering. Phi-direction angle

        15      Gamma Conversion. E plus / E gamma
        16      Gamma Conversion. Phi of Gamma Polarization


   The histograms are managed by the HistoManager class and its Messenger.
   The histos can be individually activated with the command:
   /analysis/h1/set id nbBins  valMin valMax unit
   where unit is the desired unit for the histo (MeV or keV, deg or mrad, etc..)

   One can control the name of the histograms file with the command:
   /analysis/setFileName  name  (default testem15)

   It is possible to choose the format of the histogram file : root (default),
   hdf5, xml, csv, by changing the default file type in HistoManager.cc

   It is also possible to print selected histograms on an ascii file:
   /analysis/h1/setAscii id
   All selected histos will be written on a file name.ascii (default testem15)

 6- VISUALIZATION

        The Visualization Manager is set in the main().
        The initialization of the drawing is done via the commands
        /vis/... in the macro vis.mac. To get visualization:
        > /control/execute vis.mac

        The detector has a default view which is a longitudinal view of the
        box.

        The tracks are drawn at the end of event, and erased at the end of run.

 7- HOW TO START ?

        execute TestEm15 in 'batch' mode from macro files:
                % TestEm15   compt.mac

        execute TestEm15 in 'interactive mode' with visualization:
                % TestEm15
                Idle> control/execute vis.mac
                ....
                Idle> type your commands
                ....
                Idle> exit

9 - HISTOGRAMS for gamma conversion

  10    # Open Angle (rad)* E gamma (MeV)
The most probable value of the e+ e- pair opening angle multiplied by the
photon energy is 1.6 rad*MeV and 338 rad*MeV in case mu+ mu- pair.
See: Olsen, Phys. Rev. 131 (1963) 406.
See also: Fig. 7 of arXiv:1802.08253 and Fig. 6 arXiv:1910.12501.

  11    # Log10 ( recoil momentum)
The distribution of the  recoil momentum is described by
Jost, Phys. Rev. 80 (1950) 189 (no form factor).
See also Fig. 2 of Astroparticle Physics 88 (2017) 60.

  12    # Phi recoil
  13    # Phi positron
  For linearly polarized incident photons, the distributions should show
  a sinusoidal shape with period 180Â°, for non polarized incident photons,
  the distribution of azimuthal angles should be flat.


 14    # Asymmetry 2 * cos(phi_+ + phi_-)
For a photon propagating along x, polarized along y,
the average value of ( 2.0 * cos(phi_+ + phi_-) ),
provides a measurement of the polarization asymmetry, A.
Eq. (12) of Nucl. Instrum. Meth. A 729 (2013) 765
The azimuthal angle of the event defined as the bisector angle
of the azimuthal angles of the positron and of the electron,
(phi_+ + phi_-)/2,
provides the optimal measurement of the asymmetry
Astroparticle Physics 88 (2017) 30.

For high-energy photons (E >> 20 MeV), the asymptotic expression for A
can be used for comparison.
Boldyshev, Yad. Fiz. 14 (1971) 1027, Sov.J.Nucl.Phys. 14 (1972) 576.
See also eq. (13) of arXiv:1802.08253
Example : A ~ 0.17 at 100 GeV.

  15    # E plus / E gamma
x_+ = E plus / E gamma has a more-or-less flat spectrum that extends
almost from 0. to 1.
See Fig. 16 page 261 of "The Quantum Theory of Radiation", W. Heitler,
3rd edition, 1954.

 16  # Phi of Gamma Polarization
The phi of polarization vector after transformation into reference system
 defined by gamma direction (z) , gamma polarization (x).
