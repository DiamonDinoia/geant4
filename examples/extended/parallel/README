                        Examples for event parallelism
                        ------------------------------

This directory includes example applications to demonstrate the usage of
different techniques for achieving event parallelism with Geant4.

- MPI is a native interface with MPI libraries. The directory contains 
  a Geant4 UI library and a couple of parallelized examples.
  Using this interface, users applications can be parllelized with 
  different MPI compliant libraries, such as LAM/MPI, MPICH2, OpenMPI,
  and so on.
