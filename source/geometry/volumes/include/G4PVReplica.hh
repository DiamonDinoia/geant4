 * o Radial axis (cylindrical polar) (kRho)
 *
 *   The replications are cons/tubs sections, centred on the origin

 *                      where n=0..nReplicas-1

 * initializes the value for these fields, it refers to them using a macro
 * definition defined below. For every G4PVReplica instance, there is
 * a corresponding G4ReplicaData instance. All G4ReplicaData instances are
 * organized by the class G4PVRManager as an array.
 * The field "int instanceID" is added to the class G4PVReplica.
 * The value of this field in each G4LogicalVolume instance is the subscript
 * of the corresponding G4ReplicaData instance.
 * In order to use the class  G4PVRManager, we add a static member in the
 * class G4LogicalVolume as follows: "static G4PVRManager subInstanceManager".
 * For the master thread, the array for G4ReplicaData instances grows
 * dynamically along with G4PVReplica instances arecreated.
 * For each worker thread, it copies the array of G4ReplicaData instances
 * from the master thread.
 * In addition, it invokes a method similiar to the constructor explicitly
 * to achieve the partial effect for each instance in the array.
